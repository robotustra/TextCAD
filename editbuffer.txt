# This line is a comment line
# In TextCAD description language there are end-line comments only.

# Default units of coordinates are mm.
# They also could be inch, cm, m.
# Units are the second parameter of SOC - "System of coordinates"

# Desctiption of default SOC:
 
soc default{righthanded,inch }; 



# righthanded - it means that Z axis coinsides with the vector product of axis X and Y.

# Every file of part description has the only default system of coordinates.
# We can define also as many as it's needed of SOCs with names with respect to default SOC.
# To set any other SOC we have to describe vector and angles or set them directly in the parameters

# Description of points:

dot pt1 { 0.01, 0., 0.2 }; # this point is some where in the XZ plane.

#The equivalent description of the point is 
# dot pt1 {0.01,,0.2};

# ";" is obligatuare at the end of expression and this permits to write expression more than in one line.

dot 
	pt2 
		{,,}; # here we desctibe the origin of default SOC.

dot pt3 
{
	1.0,	# X
	0.5,	# Y
			# zero Z component
};


# To define a vector we can use either one point or two points.
# In case of one point the second one has coordinates {0,0,0}. 

vector a1 { pt1 };
